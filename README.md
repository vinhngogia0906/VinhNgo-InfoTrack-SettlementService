# VinhNgo-InfoTrack-SettlementService

Welcome to InfoTrack Settlement Service. This is an attempt made by [Vinh Ngo](https://github.com/vinhngogia0906) for the InfoTrack Coding Challenge.

## This repository contains 3 separate applications:

1. [InfoTrack Settlement Service Engine](https://github.com/vinhngogia0906/VinhNgo-InfoTrack-SettlementService/tree/main/SettlementService)
  This is the backend ASP.NET application written in C# .NET Core 8.0 that uses REST API to accept booking reservations.
2. [InfoTrack Settlement Service UI](https://github.com/vinhngogia0906/VinhNgo-InfoTrack-SettlementService/tree/main/settlement-service-ui)
  This is the frontend React application written in Typescript, a support application to help using and testing the [Settlement Service Engine](https://github.com/vinhngogia0906/VinhNgo-InfoTrack-SettlementService/tree/main/SettlementService).
3. [InfoTrack Settlement Service Test](https://github.com/vinhngogia0906/VinhNgo-InfoTrack-SettlementService/tree/main/SettlementService.Tests)
  This is the xUnit application for unit testing the [Settlement Service Engine](https://github.com/vinhngogia0906/VinhNgo-InfoTrack-SettlementService/tree/main/SettlementService), its test cases are also run by the Git Action CI process whenever the `main` branch changes.
